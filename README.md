**[DEMO](https://hackernews-rails-clone.herokuapp.com/)**

This is the `readme.md` for a Ruby on Rails application that mimics social news link sharing websites like HackerNews, ProductHunt, and Reddit.

Obviously the styling is different but the base functionality exists.

### Why?

Because when i was learning to program, I wanted to play with code that had a familiar model and get some instant gratification.

The problem with learning to code is the learning-curve. Shit is real and painful and i found that the best cure for the pain was cloning an app with features and tweaking until it broke and learning along the way.

I think this is why wordpress is SO popular. Its stupid-easy to fire-up, and changes come with one-click package installs and tiny code changes.

### Change the Code!!!

My main goal for this is to give new programmers some code to look at and talk about. Anytime i [get questions](https://github.com/blairanderson/rails-hackernews-reddit-producthunt-clone/issues), I plan to add them here...

*Open your terminal*

```bash

$ git clone git@github.com:blairanderson/rails-hackernews-reddit-producthunt-clone.git
$ cd rails-hackernews-reddit-producthunt-clone
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rake db:create
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake db:seed

```
